## Background

Provided is a React Native component (`MyComponent`) which:

- Renders a list of items based on data provided via props
- Each item can be selected or not selected, and this state is toggled by tapping on the item
- It also has a search bar which filters the rendered items
- And a clear button to clear the search

Our new developer ChatGPT made the component, although there seems to be some issues when we try and use it and we think there are some things that can be improved.

## Exercise Outline

We will be reviewing the code snippet `MyComponent.tsx`

- Note down any questions or uncertainties you have! We love questions, and donâ€™t expect anyone to know everything!

We will spend ~45 minutes working together to identify any issues or improvements that can be made to the component

- Run and mount this component in a React Native environment. Playing around with the component and after reviewing the code, are there any bugs you can identify? How would you fix them?
  - d
- Are there any other improvements you believe could be made here?
- How would you test this?
